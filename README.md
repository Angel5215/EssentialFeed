# Essential Feed

This repository hosts the code following the Essential Feed case study of the iOS Lead Essentials course.

The project is divided in several modules.

## Planning, Initial System Design and Requirements Analysis.

Documentation for this section is hosted in Google Drive as all diagrams were made using the [draw.io](https://draw.io) tool.

The only code that was developed in here was the Feature Interface boundaries which include the `<FeedLoader>` and `FeedItem` (for now at least).

## Networking

Currently, the Networking section of the course follows this [Use Case](NetworkingModule.md) - which is one of the guidelines being used to develop it (being TDD and the feature intefaces the other two). The networking module is responsible for creating the API module (`RemoteFeedLoader`).
